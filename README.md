This is my personal lab for the [Open-LLM-VTuber](https://github.com/Open-LLM-VTuber/Open-LLM-VTuber) project — a place for archiving historical branches and running experiments outside the main repository.

## Why are you here?

Open-LLM-VTuber was originally hosted under my personal account at `t41372/Open-LLM-VTuber`. When we created the [Open-LLM-VTuber](https://github.com/Open-LLM-VTuber) organization and transferred the repo there, GitHub automatically set up a redirect from `t41372/Open-LLM-VTuber` → `Open-LLM-VTuber/Open-LLM-VTuber`. Everything worked great — for a while.

Later, while cleaning up old experimental branches, I forked the repo back into my namespace as `t41372/Open-LLM-VTuber` for archival purposes. I completely forgot that doing so would **break the redirect**. Now, instead of being forwarded to the main project, all those old links land here. Oops. 🫠

There are plenty of old links scattered across our docs, videos, and other people's work that still point to `t41372/Open-LLM-VTuber`, so I renamed this fork to `Open-LLM-VTuber-Lab` to restore the redirect as much as possible. It doesn't help, which is why I'm writing this.

**TL;DR:** If you're looking for the actual project, go to **[Open-LLM-VTuber/Open-LLM-VTuber](https://github.com/Open-LLM-VTuber/Open-LLM-VTuber)** 🚀


## How did I found out?

People started starring and forking this repo, which made absolutely no sense for a personal lab and I was very confused — until I realized the redirect was broken...
